// Relations will be defined here using v2 syntax when we upgrade to drizzle-orm@beta
// For now, with drizzle-orm@0.45.1, we use the v1 relations syntax if needed
// Since lookup tables don't have relations yet, this file is a placeholder

// import { relations } from "drizzle-orm"
// import * as schema from "./index"

// Example v1 syntax:
// export const kycStatusesRelations = relations(schema.kycStatuses, () => ({
//   // users: many(users),
// }))
